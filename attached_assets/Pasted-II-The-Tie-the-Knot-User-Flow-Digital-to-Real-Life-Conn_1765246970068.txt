II. The "Tie the Knot" User Flow (Digital to Real-Life Connection)

    Initial Chat (Limited): A fixed timer (e.g., 72 hours) begins upon matching. Chat is simplified (no media). Penalty for Failure: Chat is archived; both users receive a −0.1 Star Rating penalty and lose 20 FP.

    Threshold Requirement: Users must exchange a minimum of X messages each (e.g., X=5) within the time limit to unlock the "Knot Request."

    Knot Request Decision: When the threshold is met, the user is prompted to "Tie the Knot." Penalty for Refusal: Chat immediately closes; the refuser takes a −0.2 Star Rating penalty for ending an engaged conversation.

    Post-Knot Success: Chat is permanent and full features are unlocked. Reward: Both users receive a +0.1 Star Rating increase and 50 FP.

III. Public Date Spot Suggestion

    Date Proposal Tool: A "Suggest Date" button in the post-Knot chat initiates the feature to streamline scheduling.

    Location Logic: App calculates a midpoint or uses a city-center bias to determine the neutral search area.

    First-Date Filters: Map query filters for: min_rating (≥4.0), price_levels (inexpensive/moderate), and appropriate Categories (Cafes, Parks, Casual Dining). Ensures suggestions are safe and conducive to conversation.

    Location Cards: List of 3-5 suggested places showing Name, Rating, Distance, and Image.

    One-Tap Share: The "Select [Place Name] for Date" button automatically populates the chat with the address and a map link.

IV. Real-Life Date Accountability

    Accountability Timer: 24 hours prior to the date, a mandatory "Confirm Attendance" reminder is sent. Discourages last-minute ghosting.

    Post-Date Feedback Prompt: Within 12 hours after the date, users receive a persistent prompt: "How did your String meet-up go?" Drives the mandatory quality control loop.

    No-Show/Flake Penalty: Required Question: "Did your date show up?" If "No," the no-show user immediately receives a significant Star Rating deduction (−0.5) and a temporary suspension from String Radar. Punishes real-world ghosting.

    Final Knot Status: Users indicate the next step (e.g., Planning another date, Tie the Knot permanently). Tie the Knot Permanently archives the successful connection as a "Success Story."

V. Enhanced Profile Fields

    Verification Status: System-Generated (Requires Photo Verification or ID Check). Must be completed to earn the Blue Checkmark and use the Star Rating system (addresses "Fake Profiles").

    Voice Prompt: Required 15-Second Audio Recording. Proves authenticity and adds personality.

    Relationship Goal: Required Multi-Choice (The Knot, Red Thread, Casual String). Used as a hard filter for matching.

    Investment Level: Required 5-Point Slider (1=Low Effort/Browsing, 5=High Effort/Dedicated). Prioritizes users with similar effort levels.

    Values Alignment: Select 3 out of 10 Core Values (e.g., Ambition, Humor, Health). Prioritizes deeper, algorithmic compatibility.

    Deep Dive Prompts: Select 3 of 10 prompts (e.g., "The hill I will always die on is..."). Text appears in the chat to provide conversation starters.

    Life Stage: Required Dropdown (e.g., Building Career, Established Career). Matches users based on current phase of life.
